				<p>Turquoise has long held a place of significance across various cultures and civilizations. Its name is derived from the French word "turques," meaning "Turkish," as the gemstone was first brought to Europe from the mines of Persia via Turkey. The ancient Egyptians prized turquoise for its striking color, adorning tombs, jewelry, and artifacts with it, believing it to be a protective stone that connected them to divine powers. Similarly, the Native American peoples, especially the Pueblo tribes, regarded turquoise as sacred, associating it with protection, healing, and the sky. Turquoise's rich prospects and captivating hue facilitated its prominence not only as a decorative gem but also as a valuable trade item across North America and beyond, signifying wealth and status.</p>

				<p>Over the centuries, turquoise has transitioned from a revered sacred stone to a celebrated element in art and fashion. During the Art Nouveau movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, its vibrant hue inspired artists and designers, incorporating it into jewelry and decorative arts as a symbol of natural beauty. The color became increasingly popular in fashion, particularly in the mid-20th century, when it was seen in textiles, accessories, and architectural designs. The iconic "Tiffany Blue," a shade reminiscent of turquoise, has also become synonymous with luxury and elegance since its introduction by Tiffany & Co. in 1845. Today, turquoise continues to thrive in contemporary design, representing tranquility, creativity, and a connection to nature.</p>
