<h3>Biography</h3>

<p>
My name is Jackeline, but you can call me Jackie. I’m a 21-year-old filmmaker originally from Queens, New York. Currently, I'm majoring in film production with a deep passion for cinematography. For me, cinematography isn't just a technical skill; it’s a way to evoke emotion and capture the essence of storytelling through visuals.

I've always believed that every frame of a film is like a canvas where color, lighting, and framing come together to create a reaction. It fascinates me how a well-composed shot can take an audience someplace they could have never even imagined. Instead of just telling stories, I relish the challenge of showing them visually. To me, that’s the true magic of cinematography.

<p>I'm a transfer student who joined Hunter College in the spring of 2023, coming from Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC). My experiences there helped shape my understanding of filmmaking and provided me with the technical foundations I need to bring my ideas to life.

With aspirations of becoming a professional cinematographer, I am fully committed to mastering my craft. I want to not only entertain but also inspire people through my work because, at the heart of cinema, I believe lies its incredible ability to evoke genuine emotions and connections.</p>
